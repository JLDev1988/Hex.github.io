										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A GSM alarm system is also known as a landline-free or personal digital alarm. It operates precisely like any other personal alarm. It utilizes a multi-network SIM Card instead of a telephone line to contact the alarm monitoring center when the user hits their pendant button.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the mechanism of a GSM alarm?</h2>



<p>A GSM home alarm operates the same way as a cell phone SIM but can connect to more than one mobile network. A GSM alarm&#8217;s multi-network SIM will connect with the best available network to provide continuous, dependable service. Switching between networks using the SIM card in the personal alarm is possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Benefits of Installing GSM Security Alarms In Your Home?</h2>



<p>One trustworthy option for home protection is a GSM alarm system. Intruders attempting to disable your <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>home security system</strong></a> won&#8217;t succeed if they focus on disrupting your electricity or telephone service. Even if you lose mobile service, your GSM security alarm will generally operate since it is still linked to the GSM network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1-Wireless</h3>



<p>Additionally, GSM home security alarms are wireless devices. The setup of your GSM alarm will be simple and fast as a result. Because they don&#8217;t need extensive wiring to be run within the walls of your house, <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/wireless-network-security-for-small-businesses-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>wireless home security systems</strong></a> may be installed wherever you choose.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2-Flexible</h3>



<p>Your new GSM alarm system is flexible, allowing you to place sensors anywhere you see most appropriate. The security alarm control panel, sensors, cameras, and sirens of a typical wireless home security system are all powered by batteries. Home security systems that run on batteries make it simple to maintain constant power and functionality to prevent breaches in safety. </p>



<p>On top of all that, you may be able to set up your wireless home security system without hiring a professional. Don&#8217;t worry about the high expense of setup! A wireless GSM home security system is an excellent choice if you often change residences (whether you rent or own them) because of its freedom to carry your security setup.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3-Auto-Dealer</h3>



<p>You may locate a home base for your alarm system anywhere you choose. When using a GSM alarm, you may put the GSM auto-dialer base unit anywhere. A &#8220;classic&#8221; analog warning requires proximity to a telephone jack since the operators must wire it to a landline. In contrast, a GSM alarm system is not limited in this way. As long as you have a fine cell signal, you may install the base unit anywhere you&#8217;d want it, for example, in a room or kitchen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4-No Manual Call Picking&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a landline phone available at your residence, a personal alarm that uses a SIM card is the next best thing. There has been a rise in the number of individuals who use their mobile phones exclusively for making and receiving phone calls because they choose to avoid paying line rentals for a landline. You won&#8217;t have to pay the cost of installing a fixed line to use a digital GSM alarm; it will function like our regular personal alarm. You may have a whole home security system without needing a landline by combining our alarm kit with our wireless smoke detectors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5-GSM alarm guarantees Protection</h3>



<p>Since a GSM personal alarm doesn&#8217;t require an analog telephone network, it will continue to operate even after phone companies switch to digital infrastructure. Telecommunications companies are finding it more and more challenging to support the aging public switched telephone network (PSTN) that relies on analog calls. </p>



<p>Telephone companies may upgrade their services and better meet the needs of their customers by switching to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) instead. Phone companies have varying strategies and timelines for transitioning from analog phone lines. By 2025, companies want to move their subscribers to digital networks. Your cell phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about their programs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6-Inhibitor of Criminal Activity</h3>



<p>Commonly included with home alarm systems are yard signs and window decals to let others know that your house is secured. Even if no additional security measures are in place, just seeing this warning may deter would-be intruders. Make sure the stickers and notices provided by your monitoring service are prominently displayed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7-Reduced Premiums for Health Insurance</h3>



<p>Putting up a home alarm system might be expensive, but it may save you money in the long run. It might reduce your homeowner&#8217;s insurance premium if you install a security system. Having an <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/home-surveillance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>alarm system</strong></a> and, in many situations, a fire alarm may reduce the likelihood of expensive incidents resulting in a claim. Your insurance company can then reduce your premium.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where do GSM home alarm systems fall short?</h2>



<p>The SIM card in your phone is similar to the one used by GSM alarm systems, and both are used to send an alert to the authorities. Therefore, similar to a SIM card in a mobile phone, you will need to pay a monthly fee to maintain your home security system connected to the cellular network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1-Budget</h3>



<p>When budgeting for a GSM home security system, remember that it will be in addition to the usual security setup (alarm control panel, motion detection sensors, security cameras, door and window opening sensors, etc.).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2-Network Issues</h3>



<p>The signal from a GSM home security alarm may be disrupted by a cellular network jamming device, which burglars have used in the past. Given that your GSM alarm relies on the mobile network to function, it will be rendered useless if any would-be burglars can disrupt that network. </p>



<p>Do not mistake a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) home security system with a Global System for Mobile (GSM) alert. On the other hand, PSTN alarms utilize your landline connection to sound the alarm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3-False Alarms</h3>



<p>Even though a home alarm system might make you feel safer, it also irritates you. Your system will often trigger false alerts. Before you can clarify the error to your security provider, it may send the police or fire brigade to your house. Certain agencies may assess a fee if the police are summoned to your home frequently for no apparent cause. Ask your alarm provider about the potential causes of false alerts so you can disable them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s highly connected world, wireless networks are indispensable. We rely on them for social interactions, professional dealings, and internet use. Communicating to the worldwide internet through a wireless network eliminates the need for devices to be directly connected to a modem or router. </p>



<p>It is excellent for completing tasks quickly and efficiently, leaving your devices open to cyber criminals. This article will cover the many forms wireless networks may take, how they function, and the cautions you need to take to keep your data safe. Continue reading if you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about data security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Brief Explanation of Wireless Network Security</strong></h2>



<p>Computers connected to wireless networks are protected from theft and damage by using wireless security measures. Wi-Fi security, which safeguards data sent over a Wi-Fi network, is the most widely used wireless encryption. There are several methods available for securing wireless networks.)Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is the most popular kind of security now open; </p>



<p>it was intended to address the shortcomings of WEP (Wire Equivalent Privacy). The most current version of WPA security, known as WPA3, is the safest option for Wi-Fi networks. WPA3 uses AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, to encrypt data in transit across a wireless network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The question is: &#8220;What type of protection does a wireless network require?&#8221;</strong></h2>



<p>How secure your wireless network needs to be will vary depending on the type of network you use. Assuming you&#8217;re just setting up a <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/home-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>home network</strong></a>, WPA2 might be all you need. Cloud security best practices and other forms of protection, including Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and firewalls, may be necessary, however, if you have a corporate network. </p>



<p>Use robust passwords and encryption when setting up security for a wireless network. It&#8217;s also good to rotate your passwords frequently and use unique ones across your accounts and networks. Stay away from utilizing things like your birthday or mother&#8217;s maiden name since these are easy for hackers to figure out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Importance of Wireless Network Security?</strong></h2>



<p>Protecting your information from theft or misuse requires a secure wireless network. Because they rely on radio waves to transmit data, Wi-Fi networks are especially susceptible to cyberattacks, as anyone in range of the Wi-Fi signal could theoretically detect and interpret the data being sent. Wireless network security is increasingly at risk from cyberattacks, which are becoming more widespread. </p>



<p>Hackers can access private data like passwords and credit card details or even take control of networked equipment. Hackers might steal one&#8217;s identity, and anyone could lose money. Businesses and companies can only safeguard data and devices against these threats if your wireless network is secure. You can rescue your valuable information or data from hackers by securing your Wi-Fi network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Standard Threats to Network Security</strong></h2>



<p>Organizations may better protect themselves against the worst of the cyber world if they know the risks detailed below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1) Dangers to Internal Safety</strong></h3>



<p>Human mistake accounts for more than 90% of all cyberattacks. Phishing scams, poor judgment calls, and easily cracked passwords are a few examples. The effects of an insider&#8217;s activities on your company&#8217;s network and private data may be devastating, leading to downtime, lost income, and unhappy customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2) DDoS Attacks — or Distributed Denial of Service Attacks&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When a website is under assault from a distributed denial-of-service attack, the site either stops working entirely or takes an extremely long time to load. In these attacks, hackers infect internet-enabled gadgets (phones, laptops) and turn them into bots. </p>



<p>The bots are directed to the victim&#8217;s IP address by the hackers. Consequently, the site receives an overwhelming number of requests and eventually crashes under the weight of the load. There is a blurring of lines between safe and dangerous driving due to these assaults.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3) Rogue Security Software in the Software Security Industry</strong></h3>



<p>Fake antivirus programs deceive organizations into thinking their network is infected and down. In most possibilities, this takes the formation of cautionary notice from a reliable anti-malware program. </p>



<p>If a user&#8217;s device becomes infected, the virus will send repeated messages demanding payment for a &#8220;<a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/home-surveillance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>security solution</strong></a>&#8221; that does not exist. Malicious software may even compromise your current <a href="https://www.smaestimating.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cybersecurity</strong></a> measures and extend the duration of an assault.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4) Malware</strong></h3>



<p>Malware is designed to steal data from infected computers. After a successful rollout, devices may be mined by hackers for sensitive data (email addresses, banking information, and passwords) that can be used for identity theft, blackmail, or other activities that cause harm to a company. Computer worms may quickly propagate from one system to another by using security holes. </p>



<p>Without the awareness of their targets, rootkits may provide unauthorized users with fraudulent access privileges to compromised systems. Trojan infections can infiltrate networks undetected because they ride along on legitimate programs, giving criminals extraordinary access. The malware collects information on how devices are used by their owners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5) Ransomware</strong></h3>



<p>Malware, known as ransomware, encrypts data on affected computers and demands a ransom be paid in exchange for the decryption key. It may manifest as ransomware offered as a service (RaaS). RaaS functions similarly to SaaS but is tailored to ransomware. </p>



<p>With the help of RaaS providers, customers may purchase the source code necessary to create malware and conduct cyberattacks on a large scale. Some widely accepted RaaS examples include LockBit, BlackMatter, DarkSide, and Ravil.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6) Attacks using Phishing</strong></h3>



<p>Hackers use phishing attempts to gain network access and steal sensitive information like credit card numbers by posing as a fair enterprise or government agency. Emails and phone calls are all common vectors for phishing attacks. Phishing assaults, like fake antivirus programs, aim to fool users into thinking they are dealing with a trusted source. It makes it more likely that prey will engage with malware by visiting fraudulent websites or opening dangerous attachments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7) Viruses</strong></h3>



<p>Downloadable documents from emails or sites often come with malicious software. Once the file is opened, the virus infects your machine via software flaws, allowing it to steal information, damage networks, and more. You can&#8217;t just wipe off a virus as you would a worm. Although both are malicious software, their methods of network intrusion are distinct. Computer viruses cannot infect a system until the host file (the file) is opened. Once a worm enters a company&#8217;s computer system, it may spread across the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How To Protect Your Wireless Network?</strong></h2>



<p>The use of WPA2 security is recommended for protecting your wireless network. WPA2 employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, widely regarded as the industry standard for safety. Also, ensure your passwords are secure and updated often. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Security Agency</strong></a> says that users of wireless networks, whether individuals or corporate, must regularly change default passwords as they are subject to manipulation and only offer moderate protection. Also, using sensitive information like your name or birthday as a password is not suitable.</p>



<p>Other protection methods, like virtual private networks (VPNs) and firewalls, may be necessary for a business network. If your network is compromised, you should consider using a cloud-based network security solution to safeguard your data. Protecting Service Set Identifiers, using file-sharing services with caution, and keeping antivirus software updated are some additional practical suggestions (SSID). </p>



<p>This article elaborates on SSIDs. Security precautions should be taken with any wireless network. Your data will be more secure if you use wireless security methods like WPA2 security and robust passwords.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Exactly Is Business Wi-Fi Safety?</strong></h2>



<p>Protecting and safeguarding a company&#8217;s wireless network is known as business wireless security. Because of their greater size and complexity, enterprise wireless networks need advanced wireless network security measures more than personal wireless networks. For instance, enterprise wireless security protects the network that links computers, servers, and mobile devices in institutions like government agencies, educational institutions, and private businesses. </p>



<p>Enterprise wireless security methods include firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion detection systems (IDS), data leak prevention systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs) (VPNs). In the commercial realm, ACLs are called Identity and Access Management. Here you may learn more about these actions. Always go for the safest options available when installing corporate wireless security to keep your network free from harm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Do Large Businesses Stress Over Wireless Threats to Data Security?</strong></h2>



<p>Businesses are legitimately worried about wireless network security risks due to the sensitive information that has to be protected. They employ wireless network security specialists to protect company data from hackers and other malicious actors. Experts with wireless network security credentials, such as the CISCO credential, demonstrate the knowledge and abilities necessary to aid in business network security. </p>



<p>Employers will have more faith in your skills and abilities if you have a reputable certification. Earning the CISCO credential demonstrates to your customer that you have the knowledge and skills necessary to implement the highest standards of network security in a business setting.</p>

We can improve the quality of your living environment by installing the most cutting-edge home theatre, <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/home-networking/"><strong>home automation, audio video, security, and networking systems</strong></a> that money can buy.</p>



<p>The future of energy-efficient, long-range, and cost-effective intelligent homes is promising. Devices that are driven by the Internet of Things are getting us closer and closer to this reality. Interoperability will not only be a priority for successful innovators when it comes to gadgets but also when it comes to other platforms. This article on <a href="https://hexacontrol.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Hexa Control</strong></a> looks at ten technology advancements already commonplace in many people&#8217;s homes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Broadband Systems</h2>



<p>Because most individuals now have access to broadband internet in their homes at high speeds, dial-up connections are becoming a thing for most people.</p>



<p>People with broadband internet access in their homes may use modern conveniences like streaming movies and music, surfing the internet, making video calls, and downloading enormous files in a hurry.</p>



<p>Access to a dependable and speedy internet connection also serves as a doorway to various contemporary products that, in principle, are intended to make our lives simpler or more fun.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">TVs with Internet connectivity</h3>



<p>Disc and movie players have mostly been rendered obsolete by the proliferation of smart TVs in many homes.</p>



<p>Movies, television shows, and music may all be streamed via televisions connected to a high-speed internet connection, allowing users to surf the internet.</p>



<p>According to the watchdog organization Ofcom, intelligent TVs were present in 42 percent of homes in the United Kingdom in 2017, up from only 5 percent in 2012.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gaming Studios and Play Stations</h2>



<p>Regarding playing games online, gamers who used consoles and personal computers in the 1990s and early 2000s had a more limited selection of options than now.</p>



<p>As a result of the proliferation of high-speed internet connections and the creation of gaming consoles such as Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox and Sony&#8217;s PlayStation, gamers can now compete against opponents from all over the world with relative ease.</p>



<p>This technology has created a growth in e-sports, with the finest players in the world receiving enormous cash prizes for their exploits in games like Street Fighter and Fortnite. A 16-year-old boy named Kyle Giersdorf from Pennsylvania just won $3 million while playing the video game Fortnite.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Smart Meter</h2>



<p>Smart meters are devices that may &#8220;provide customers near genuine live statistics on energy consumption,&#8221; according to Ofgem, the energy regulator in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>According to the theory behind this concept, consumers can &#8220;better control their energy consumption, save money, and cut emissions&#8221; if they can monitor how much power they are consuming.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Streaming</h3>



<p>Streaming has fundamentally altered how we consume media on mobile phones, tablets, laptops, or intelligent TVs.</p>



<p>Using cutting-edge home automation systems, you may immediately access movies and television shows via subscription platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, all of which charge a monthly cost. The same may be said for musical content on sites such as Spotify and Tidal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Virtual assistants</h2>



<p>Virtual assistants are quickly becoming a familiar fixture in many households, whether it&#8217;s Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, Apple&#8217;s Siri, or Google&#8217;s Home. These pieces of hardware respond to voice instructions to perform various functions, including playing music, delivering weather predictions, and offering advice on how to cook certain dishes.</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, customers have control over more than 80,000 different devices connected with Google Home, including TVs, lights, and thermostats.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Smart Ovens</h3>



<p>Although the exteriors of the ovens used to prepare our meals may resemble those many common decades ago, the components housed inside these ovens are evolving.</p>



<p>Smart ovens of today can be managed verbally, switched on and off remotely, and users may get reminders when their meal is done cooking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Robotic vacuums</h3>



<p>Several well-known brands, such as Dyson, Hoover, and Miele, offer Robot vacuums. These machines move autonomously across houses while simultaneously hoovering up dirt and dust, eliminating the need for strenuous cleaning efforts.</p>



<p>Even though a robot vacuum cleaner could make your life easier, some people are wary of them.</p>



<p>After receiving reports of an intruder, Oregon sheriff&#8217;s officers were sent to a home, where they found their suspect to be a vacuum cleaner going about its business.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Smart locks</h3>



<p>Hexa Control&#8217;s smart locks that You can open without the need for keys are becoming an increasingly popular option for certain people as a handy method to secure their belongings. With the help of our intelligent security systems, you may manage these locks by inputting a password or via an app, and they are starting to open the door to various secondary uses.</p>



<p>The &#8220;While You&#8217;re Away&#8221; delivery service being tested by Waitrose, a grocery chain in the United Kingdom, will be expanded, as the firm announced in July.</p>



<p>Waitrose delivery drivers can enter customers&#8217; homes thanks to technology developed by Yale called intelligent locks. The consumer generates a short unlock code for their door, which is then delivered to Waitrose through an encrypted mobile application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Smart doorbells</h3>



<p>When keeping one&#8217;s house secure, installing an intelligent doorbell may provide additional protection to a residence.</p>



<p>A diverse selection of items are available for purchase, but most function similarly. When someone tries to enter the homeowner&#8217;s property, the homeowner is alerted, often on their mobile phone, via a notification sent when the doorbell rings or when one of the motion sensors is triggered. They can identify the individual using their mobile phone and, if required, communicate with that individual.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Smart Security Cameras</h2>



<p>Smart security cameras have replaced security guards. You cannot imagine the world is adopting technology.
