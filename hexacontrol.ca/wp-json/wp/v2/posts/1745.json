Both these have led to increase in production of crops. ______ Small farmers usually need to borrow money to arrange for the capital, and are put to great distress to repay the loan.<\/p>\n<p>The rate of interest on such loans is very high. Most small farmers have to borrow money to arrange for the working capital. They are put to a great distress to repay the loan. Among the three factors of production, we found that labour is the most abundant factor of production.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"toc-1\">LONG QUESTIONS<\/h2>\n<p>Farming is the main production activity in the village Palampur. New schemes should be launched for the sake of farmers who lose because of these natural hazards. The government should concentrate on these issues and try to solve them so as to increase the cultivable land and increase the food grains. The food grain production is not increasing or expanding in proportion to the population. It is the time for searching for new ways of increasing the production of food grains.<\/p>\n<p>However, some wastelands in India had been converted into cultivable land after 1960. Most of the people are dependent on farming for their livelihood. They depend on moneylenders for loans. Sometimes they take loans from banks also.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"toc-2\">h Class Social 9th Lesson Rampur: A Village Economy 2 Marks Important Questions and Answers<\/h2>\n<p>The entire land is cultivated in village Palampur.

There are laTge number of small farmers who cultivate small plots of land, and live in conditions not much better than the landless farm labourers.<\/p>\n<p>My opinion is that the issue discussed in this paragraph is correct. The basic factor of production is land. This indicates that there is no equal distribution of land among farmers. The remaining 13% of the farmers are medium and large farmers.<\/p>\n<p>Labour represents all the people that are available to transform resources into goods or services that can be purchased. Green Revolution was started in the late 1960s in the field of agriculture.

There is often a loss inform activities, especially when crops are damaged because of floods, pests, etc. The other risk is sudden fall in price of agricultural produce.<\/p>\n<p>They are put to great distress to repay the loan. Sometimes the small farmers have to work on the fields of medium and large farmers at very low wages to repay the loan. Among these factors of production, labour is the most abundant factor of production. There are many people who are willing to work as farm labourers in the villages whereas the opportunities of work are limited. They belong to either landless families or small farmers They are paid low wages and lead a difficult life.<\/p>\n<p>(Very little\/nearly half\/majority \/all). In Palampur, about one-third of the 450 families are landless, i.e., 150 families. Most of them are dalits, and have no land for cultivation. As a result, by mid-1970s, the entire cultivated area of 200 hectares (ha.) was irrigated. To grow three different crops in a year in Palampur is due to the well-developed system of irrigation.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the small farmers have to borrow money to arrange for the capital. Small farmers, land, fixed, unequally, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, multiple cropping technique, capital, Land, capital. This clearly shows the inequality in the distribution of cultivated land. AnswerThe working capital required by the farmer using modern farming methods are raw material and money. Money is always required during production to make payments and buy other necessary items.
